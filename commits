PATCH 1 :

install_wiki.sh expects the first argument to be 'install' or 'delete'
'install' installs a MediaWiki on the web's server with SQLite3
'delete' deletes the previously created wiki. Note those
functionnalities are made to be used from the user command line in the
directory /t

install_wiki also defines a function cmd_reset which clear all content
of the previously created wiki. Note this functionnality is made to be
used only by our test function in a subdirectory of t/

PATCH 2

In order to test git-remote-mediawiki, we need a package of functions 
to manage a MediaWiki: edit a page, remove a page, fetch a page, 
fetch all pages on a given wiki.

We also need functions to compare the content of directories.
