PATCH 1 :

The tests required a wiki installed on localhost, which can be fairly long.
The script install_wiki.sh requires minimum preconditions and interaction,
so it can be run directly in the script testing mediawiki.

-- OLD --
install_wiki.sh expects the first argument to be 'install' or 'delete'
'install' installs a MediaWiki on the web's server with SQLite3
'delete' deletes the previously created wiki. Note those
functionnalities are made to be used from the user command line in the
directory /t

install_wiki also defines a function cmd_reset which clear all content
of the previously created wiki. Note this functionnality is made to be
used only by our test function in a subdirectory of t/

PATCH 2
